# Disrupt Design System

Welcome to the **Disrupt Design System** – a unified design language and component library powering all Disrupt products.

## Products Using This System

This design system provides a consistent, scalable foundation for:

- **Disrupt Inc.** – Corporate website
- **Disrupt Flow** – Product 1
- **Disrupt Market** – Product 2
- **Disrupt Partner** – Product 3

## What's Inside

### 🎨 Design Tokens
Centralized design values including colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and more. All tokens are defined in `designTokens.ts` and consumed across all products.

### 🧩 Components
Reusable React components built with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and designed for maximum flexibility.

### ✨ Visual Effects
- **Glassmorphism** – Frosted glass UI effects with 4 surface presets
- **Grid Patterns** – Background decorative grids with customizable sizes and colors
- **Gradients** – Predefined gradient overlays for hero sections

### 📐 Patterns
Common UI patterns and compositions like hero sections, pricing cards, feature grids, and contact forms.

## Technology Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Radix UI** for accessible primitives

## Design Principles

1. **Consistency** – Same look and feel across all products
2. **Accessibility** – WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
3. **Performance** – Optimized components and minimal bundle size
4. **Scalability** – Easy to extend and maintain
5. **Developer Experience** – Well-documented with TypeScript support
